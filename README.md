### General Info
***
This was an analysis that was done on a physics project I completed in undergrad where we created superconducting microchips using different substrates as a conductor. We focused on measuring the voltage in and out of the chips as well as observed the nuclear magnetic resonance phenomena (http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/nmr/whatisnmr/whatisnmr.html).
## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Version 1.2.4
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Version 3.4.2
